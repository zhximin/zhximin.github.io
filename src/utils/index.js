	eng: `Like stability not anxious not busy not lazy.//
Before you give up fight hard just afraid of old heart and long road.//
From dawn to dusk there is more sunshine than all poetry.//
The world is like a sky full of stars but you are like a bright white moon. The stars hold the moon and only you are dazzling.//
Gentleness is my definition. Whether you like it or not is your freedom.//
Contented and progressive gentle and firm.//
We walked slowly along the long road.//
The setting sun returns to the mountains and seas and the wetland is covered with glow.//
Even if you are not dazzling you are still unique.//
Those young miss is the memory of the wet cherry blossom fragrance.//
I'm following you now.I'm just going to follow you everywhere.I'm just going to follow you the rest of my life.//
The moonlight is especially gentle and the world is romantic.//At this time there is nothing wrong with the little fairy.//
I like crispy peaches and windy evenings.//
If you don't have company you'll lose this obsession.//
These messy lives will get better one day.//
With one heart and one mind there are four seasons.//
Life is not a choice but love.//
Although the road ahead is far walking constantly the heart is like flowers and trees born in the sun.//
Cater to the years and strive to grow.//
There are gullies in the heart and the eyebrows and eyes are mountains and rivers.//
The moon shines back on the lake and wild cranes rush to the idle clouds.//
Those who pursue light will eventually shine.//I will not squint and always will.//
If you are confused and want to ask the evening of the flat sea is long.//
May someone know your ups and downs and understand your joys and sorrows.//
The Milky way at dusk don't waste your weight in your dreams.//
Let bygones be bygones and the future be bygones.//
The world is big happy first.//
She was right next to me and I was looking at her side face.//
All the treks are for arrival.//
Like you there is no production date and no shelf life.//
The flowers bloom with sound and the years are quiet.//
Life is full of power because of ideals.//
Wear your favorite clothes and get along with people who are not tired.//
God said that the young man was startled but he danced lightly under the moon.//
I take root and grow and flow naturally.//Close the florist and I'll sail by myself.//
If you catch up with spring in Jiangnan you must live with spring.//
Give your lover a romance life is a kind of poetry.//
You are the star hanging at night and the moon rising at Dongshan.//
Be a romantic person and live up to the promise of poetry wine and Camellia.//
I hope you are real bright and warm.//
A little flower I can't think of it so I'll thank you.//
Bright in the sun and dazzling in the dark; If the heart is sunny it is fearless to be sad.//
Growth is nothing more than getting drunk. Brave people do it first.//
I don't expect flowers to bloom. I don't like flowers for a long time.//
Holding fireworks to make a living poetic to seek love.//
Each carries the current and goes up and rejoices with each other.//
We went into the night sea to salvage the lost stars.//
Years and months are like songs the sun and moon are long and the days are ordinary. Time passes leisurely in small things.//
Only when we are not afraid of difficulties the road ahead will be wider and wider.//
Respect all voices but only be yourself.//
If I don't receive the owl invitation I will still cut through the thorns and thorns in the Muggle world.//
Today is very good. I like today.//The road is rugged but the light is always on.//
Where you are loneliness is conquered.//
The moonlight under the forest is as sparse as residual snow.//
Even if life is low in the dust dreams should be held high.//No waves with the wind no advice against the wind.//
I set off mountains and rivers to you step into the stars to visit you and I have the whole universe to tell you.//
Be quiet and innocent as in the morning.//Have a hunch all know all understand.//
He didn't treat me half well but it happened that his feelings were growing like weeds.//
The road is ahead but also at your feet.//
The sun is bright the sky is blue and the water is clear. The leaves of the trees are colorful colorful and picturesque.//
Explain so much it's better to learn more by falling down.//
You are in my arms the universe is complete.//
Although the road of life is long the important point is often only a few steps.//
The brilliance of your body is better than the starlight of the birth of the universe.//
When you are alone you must be kind to yourself.//Don't lose your dream because there is no applause.//
You're here. All the love I collected before has a backer.//
There is no attachment to the future. What is worth looking forward to is only the distance.//
Life is warm and pure not giving up love and freedom.//
May all the people who move forward with a heavy load come back with a full load.//
The sun and moon shine on the Chinese year and the landscape reads the world.//
There is a long way to go and more than dreams.//
In the past you may as well stop where you know.//
I don't catch any waves or take any boats. I have my own sea.//
There is light in the eyes and direction in the heart.`,
	str: `喜欢稳定,不急不忙,也不懒散。//
在你放弃之前,好好拼一把,只怕心老,不怕路长。//
从黎明到黄昏,阳光充足,胜过一切的诗。//
世人皆如满天星,而你却如皎皎白月,众星捧月,唯你耀眼。//
温柔是我的定义,喜不喜欢是你的自由。//
知足且上进,温柔且坚定。//
长长的路,我们慢慢地走。//
落日归山海,湿地披霞光。//
你即使不耀眼,依旧独一无二。//
那些年少错过,是回忆里被淋湿的樱花香。//
我要跟着你,你去哪儿我都要跟着你,我这辈子都跟定你了。//
月色尤其温柔,人间皆是浪漫。//
此时情绪此时天,无事小神仙。//
喜欢脆一点的桃子,和有风的傍晚。//
如果不曾相伴,便少了这份痴缠。//
这些乱七八糟的生活,总有一天会好起来。//
一心无累,四季良辰。//
生活不是选择,而是热爱。//
前路虽远,步履不停,心如花木,向阳而生。//
迎合岁月,努力生长。//
心中有丘壑,眉目做山河。//
月亮照回湖心,野鹤奔向闲云。//
追光的人,终会光芒万丈。//
我将目不斜视,而且永远如此。//
迷津欲有问,平海夕漫漫。//
愿有人知你冷暖,懂你悲欢。//
日暮银河,别在梦里蹉砣。//
往事不再过问,未来共赴前程。//
世界很大,开心第一。//
她就在我旁边,而我在看她的侧脸。//
所有跋涉,都是为了抵达。//
喜欢你,没有生产日期,也没有保质期。//
花开有声,岁月静好。//
人生因有理想,而充满动力。//
穿自己喜欢的衣服,和不累的人相处。//
神说少年惊鸿,倒是月下翩跹。//
我扎根生长,也自然流淌。//
把花店关了,我自己远航。//
若到江南赶上春,千万和春住。//
给爱人一个浪漫,生活是一种诗意。//
你是夜幕星垂,也是月出东山。//
做一个浪漫的人,不负诗酒茶花之约。//
希望你真实,明亮而热烈。//
一朵小花,想不开就谢了。//
阳光下灿烂,黑暗下耀眼；心若向阳,无畏悲伤。//
成长无非大醉一场,勇敢的人先干为敬。//
我不期待花开了,我早就不喜欢花了。//
手执烟火以谋生,心怀诗意以谋爱。//
各自承流而上,互为欢喜人间。//
我们走进夜海,去打捞遗失的繁星。//
岁月如歌,日月悠长,日子平常,光阴在细微的小事里悠悠然而过。//
只有不畏艰难,眼前的路才会越走越宽。//
尊重所有的声音,但只成为自己。//
没有收到猫头鹰请柬的我,依旧会在麻瓜的世界里披荆斩棘。//
今天很好,我喜欢今天。//
那路是崎岖的,灯却永远亮着。//
你所在之处,孤单都被征服。//
林下漏月光,疏疏如残雪。//
即使生活低到尘埃里,梦想也要举得高高的。//
顺风不浪,逆风不怂。//
我掀起山河奔向你,踏进星辰来访你,我有整个宇宙想讲给你听。//
静悄悄地做人,像早晨一样清白。//
有预感,都知道,都明白。//
他未对我半分好,偏巧这感情疯长似野草。//
路在前方,更在脚下。//
阳光明媚,蓝天碧水,树木叶间五彩斑斓,色彩艳丽,如诗如画。//
解释那么多,不如自己摔一跤学会的更多。//
你在我的怀中,宇宙才完整。//
人生的道路虽然漫长,但要紧处常常只有几步。//
你周身的璀璨,胜于宇宙诞生的星光。//
独来独往的日子里,一定要善待自己。//
不要因为没有掌声,而丢掉自己的梦想。//
你来了,我之前收藏的爱意都有了靠山。//
来路无可眷恋,值得期待的只有远方。//
一生温暖纯良,不舍爱与自由。//
愿所有的负重前行,都可以满载而归。//
日月照华年,山水阅尘寰。//
前路很长,梦想不止。//
人生过往,会心处不妨停一停。//
不赶什么浪潮,也不搭什么船,我自己有海。//
眼中有光,心里有方向。`,
